        The Causes and Linguistic Features of “Tu Wei” Love Words<br>
Wu Jingyi<br><br><br>



The Social Media Research Center of Beijing University once wrote in an article: “(popular words) this kind of carnival-like language game among the masses is actually a typical specimen for studying the spiritual life of the masses, the behavior of social groups, and the trend of popular culture.”

“Tu Wei” generally refers to language, actions or behaviors that do not conform to the trend and are relatively low, but in “Tu Wei” Love Words, earth flavor often refers to down-to-earth and unpretentious language expressions. The “Tu Wei” love words comes from the “Tu Wei”  culture, and it has always existed, such as “5201314 (I love you forever)” which was popular around 2010, but it is only a minority language phenomenon and has not been paid attention to.

“Tu Wei”  love words can be divided into homonyms and homonyms; homophones refer to two or more words with the same pronunciation but different meanings, such as revenge and ambition, unknown and ominous, power and rights; “Tu Wei”  love words are based on oral communication Primary form, focusing on 
phonetic rhetoric such as:

⑴ - 我想去换个造型 (I want to change my look)
     - 什么造型 (What look?)
     - 没你不行 (It’s not okay without you)
⑵ - 什么酒醉人？( What kind of drink is easy to get drunk? )
     - 什么酒？( What drink? )
     - 我和你的天长地久。( Our being together long. )

The phonetic changes increase the interest of the sentences. The phonetic feasibility of “Tu Wei”  love words is mainly due to the large number of homonyms in Chinese. They have the same pronunciation but different meanings. When they are used in this kind of Internet language, they add new connections. Homophonic transformation changes the original meaning to express a new meaning. The pronunciation of “造型（look）” in ⑴ is the same as that of 






“行 (Okay)”, and the pronunciation of “酒 (wine)” and “久（long）”in ⑵ is the same.

Homographs are words that have the same form but different meanings, including pronunciation and spelling. Simply put, polysemy is only homonym. For example:

⑶ 我的手被划了一道口子，你也划一下，我们就是两口子了。(My hand was cut, you do it too, then we are husband and wife.)
⑷ 不要抱怨，抱我。 (Don’t complain, hug me)

The words used in homographs generally have both superficial and deep meanings at the same time, and speakers are accustomed to using superficial meanings to cover up deep meanings. Taking ⑶ as an example, the superficial meaning of the “口子（wound）”is two wounds cut by a knife, and the deep meaning is the husband and wife. The speaker expresses his meaning implicitly and euphemistically. ⑷ does not directly express the idea of asking for a hug.

The “Tu Wei”  words of vocabulary are to dismantle the form or meaning of the expressed words to enhance the expression effect.

The first method is to disassemble the word form, segmenting the grapheme or word form, for example:

⑸ “从今以后，我只能称呼你为您了，因为你在我心上” (“From now on, I can only call you you, because you are on my heart”)
⑹ “你今天特别讨厌，讨人喜欢和百看不厌。”
“You are particularly annoying today, likable and never tired of watching.”

In ⑸, the speaker divides you into “you” and “heart” from top to bottom, that is, you are on my heart. ⑹ splits the words formally, splits hate into two words, takes one word for each, and creates reversal and humor.

The second method is meaning dismantling, dismantling the meaning of a word and knowing its connotation through association. 
For example:

⑺ 我送你一个指南针，防止我把你惯得找不着北。( I’ll give you a compass to prevent me from spoiling you so much that you can’t find the north. )
⑻ - 我在找一条路 (I’m looking for a way)
     - 什么路？(What way?)
     - 阿姨洗铁路。( Aunty washes rail )
      
The function of the compass in ⑺ is to point out the direction, which echoes the “can’t find north” in the second half of the sentence. ⑻’s “阿姨洗铁路” is a transliteration of “I love you” in Japanese.

The last is the rhetorical pun, which refers to the use of polysemy or homonym in a certain language environment to make a sentence have two meanings. like:

⑼ 你有一个缺点，缺点我。( You have a shortcoming, lack me. )

The superficial meaning means that you have a shortcoming, but the deep meaning is that you lack me. In rhetorical psychology, the rhetorical text form of puns is related to psychological distance, and “there are words in words” are used to create a comfortable psychological distance between both parties.

The composition and application of “Tu Wei”  love words rely on the environment of the times and cultural context. It is implicit and euphemistic in style, and has multiple layers of semantics in semantic expression; there are differences between the outside and the inside. The implicit style focuses on figures of speech such as metaphors, puns, and twists and turns, and is graceful and indirect in expression. This reminds me of the author Kitagawa Rie’s “Three Love Letters” wrote: “If human beings have tails, it’s a bit embarrassing to say, as long as they are with you, they can’t stop shaking.”

        1. 土味 (tǔ wèi)：(neologism, slang) countryside-style; old-fashioned; cringeworthy. “Tu Wei” is a Chinese term that can be translated to “local flavor” or “country style.” It refers to cultural phenomena that are unique to a particular region, town, or rural area in China. Tu Wei is often associated with rustic or old-fashioned things, such as traditional crafts, rural customs, or retro fashion styles.
