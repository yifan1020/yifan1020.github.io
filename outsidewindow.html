            At first, my subject was the tree outside my window, I wanted to photograph it because it was close to me,
            then it was so big that it took up my entire field of view outside the window; it was the first thing I saw
            when I woke up every morning body and the last living thing I see at the end of each day.<br><br>

            Sometimes looking at it, it feels like it is conscious and sentient. When I leave the curtains and turn off
            the light to go to bed, I can see its shadow cast on the ceiling, and it will shake very badly when the
            weather is bad. It feels like it wants to break through the window. I opened the photo album on my mobile
            phone and found that I had taken a lot of pictures of it, so I decided to take a video of this tree. But
            then when I looked at the tree in the camera, things around me started to grab my attention too, so I
            started to focus on other things, like pedestrians, dogs, and road furniture. I ended up shooting two
            hundred videos and I cut them down to 4 minutes. I’m not sure what I want to express through this video, but
            I like to stand in front of the window and look at the road outside the window.
