            “Close reading is an exercise to hone attention and engagement as well as a strategy for liberation.”<br>
            —Kameelah Janan Rasheed: Are We Reading Closely?<br><br>


            Are we reading closely? Are we reading with care?<br><br>

            Here's a book I made out of my collection of New Yorker magazines.The scattered magazine is filled with scraps of text I found in The New Yorker, cartoons, and notes I made.
            It shows the process of collection, organization, translation, mistranslation, and, above all, unlearning.
            At the same time, it can also be used as a portrayal of my special reading interest. As an object, the
            magazine is also a form of time. It contains traces that I highlighted
            and translated.
