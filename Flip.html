    <h1>A Flip Book</h1>

            A book I made for one of my favorite artists, Gu Dexin. The book is full of pictures of his works,
            and while flipping through the pages, the images will be enlarged or reduced, or moved up, down, left, or
            right. Each page contains a word, forming a paragraph of text.
            <!-- In 1972, Sui Jianguo, at the age of 16, replaced his mother and became a worker in the drum-shaking workshop
            of Qingdao National Cotton Factory No. 2. In 1977, at the age of 20, Wang Guangyi left a farm in
            Heilongjiang province where he had been an educated youth for four years and became a road builder in Harbin
            Railway Bureau. At the end of the 1970s, workers’ children Gu Dexin entered the plastic factory to do
            temporary work; At the same time, Zhuang Hui,16, entered Luoyang Dongfanghong Tractor Factory and became a
            sand miner; In 1992, Zeng Hong, the son of the third line factory, became a teacher in the secondary school
            affiliated to Sichuan Zizhong Petroleum Machinery Factory after graduating from secondary school. He left
            the factory in 2000 after taking a buyout. It is an exciting but overlooked fact that many of China’s
            contemporary artists come from working-class families and have experience working in large state-owned
            factories, witnessing the changes in factories at different times in history.<br>
            ­­— The Exodus from the Bottom: The Neglected “worker experience” and Contemporary Art Practice in China<br><br>


            Among these artists, I like Gu Dexin the most. In 2013, when I was working at Shanghai Gallery of Art, I was
            attracted by his artist catalog. In 1989, Gu, Yang Jiechang and Huang Yongping participated in the
            exhibition “Magicians of the Earth” held by the Pompidou Center in Paris. His works are two installations
            sintered from waste plastic. After the exhibition, the other two artists stayed in Europe, while Gu returned
            to Beijing.<br><br>

            After the Pompidou exhibition, Gu Dexin created many installation works, most of which are made of fragile
            and perishable materials. In kneading meat into jerky, the artist repeatedly kneads a piece of fresh meat
            until it is kneaded into jerky and takes a photo of each piece of meat. The jerky exhibited at UCCA was
            completed from 1997 to 2000. During that period, Gu bought a piece of meat every month, cut the meat into 36
            pieces and kneaded them one by one, put them into plastic boxes, and put the date on them for storage. Why
            cut it into 36 slices? Gu De explained: “A film box has exactly 36 photos.”<br><br>

            In the exhibition titled “2006.09.02” held at the Continuing Gallery, 8 tons of apples were covered two
            hours before the opening, and they rotted slowly during the exhibition.<br><br>

            The retrospective’s title, “The Important Thing Is Not the Meat,” borrows directly from the title of a 2003
            essay by the art critic Qiu Zhijie. At that time, many artists used animal flesh and even baby corpses as
            materials for their creations, which were criticized by many parties. Audiences at home and abroad often
            accuse these works of “violence” and “perversion,” and some domestic critics say that these creations are to
            curry favor with “Western powers.”<br><br>

            Qiu Zhijie’s article refuted the accusations of “violence” and “pleasing” in a tit-for-tat manner,
            emphasizing the seriousness of these artists’ creations and the value of these experiments. Gu Dexin’s
            attitude is relatively mild. He once said: “It is interesting for the audience to interpret in their way...
            I want to provide the audience with a space without ‘language barriers.’ The titles of my works are The
            exhibition’s opening date is also based on this idea.”<br><br>

            Swiss collector Uli Sigg also collected Gu Dexin’s work of kneading meat into jerky: a pile of fresh meat is
            placed on a chair, and the flesh slowly rots during the exhibition.<br><br>

            Gu quit the art circle in 2009. I take this book as an opportunity to present his works again. Most of the
            pictures of his works are taken in Shanghai Gallery of Art. -->
