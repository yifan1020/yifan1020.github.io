            A collage website of poems with the moon as an image. It looks like it is only composed of scattered
            black squares of different sizes. When the mouse moves over the black squares, it seems to light a moon, and
            you can read the poems.<br><br><br><br>



            ︶<br>
            The wine among the flowers,<br>
            O lonely me!<br>
            Ah, moon, aloof and shining,<br>
            I drink to thee.<br><br><br>


            ︵︶<br>
            Beside me, see my shadow,<br>
            Rejoice we three!<br>
            Moon, why remote and distant?<br>
            Dance with my shade and me.<br><br><br>


            ︵︶ ︵<br>
            This joy shall last for ever,<br>
            Moon, hear my lay,<br>
            My shade and I can caper<br>
            Like clouds away.<br><br><br>


            ︵︶ ︵︶<br>
            And drunk we are united<br>
            (But lone by day)<br>
            Let’s fix eternal trysting<br>
            In the Milky Way.<br><br>
            Winifred Galbraith’s English translation of the original poem by Li Bai (BAYAMUS, p.66)<br><br>

            Stefan Themerson used 4 pages (BAYAMUS, pp.69-72) to perform a “Semantic Poetry Translation” of Chinese Tang
            Dynasty poet Li Bai’s “Drinking under the Moon”. This style of poetry demonstrates a concern for the reality
            hiding behind language, or, in Themerson’s words, an acute awareness of the existence of facts under the
            symbolism of labels.<br><br>

            In ancient poetry, some characters contain fixed images, such as “Moon”. “Moon” is a vision imaginable as a
            meaning, and a natural scene of feeling. The full moon can be compared to the reunion of people, while the
            waning moon means parting. “Moon” can also symbolize longing:<br><br>

            “床前明月光，疑是地上霜。举头望明月，低头思故乡。”<br><br>

            The moonlight shines before my bed.<br>
            I think it must be frost there down,<br>
            But then I watch above the moon,<br>
            And now I miss afar my town.<br><br>
            Li Bai also extended the moon as a crystal clear realm In “《玉阶怨》” (An Imperial Concubine Waiting at Night),
            and used the purity of nature to correspond to the purity of people’s hearts, and regarded the moon as the
            most beautiful and purest symbol.<br><br>

            “玉阶生白露，夜久侵罗袜。却下水精帘，玲珑望秋月。”<br><br>

            Waiting, she finds her silk stockings<br>
            soaked with the dew drops<br>
            glistening on the marble palace steps.<br>
            Finally, she is moving<br>
            to let the crystal-woven curtain fall<br>
            when she casts one more glance<br>
            at the glamorous autumn moon.<br><br>

            The reason why the ancients have a special liking for the “moon” is because the ancients believed that the
            moon seen in different places is the same, and that the moon can transcend space.<br><br>

            Where does the idiom “Jade Ax Repairing the Moon” come from? How did people in the Tang Dynasty know that
            the surface of the moon is uneven. The idiom “Jade Ax Repairing the Moon” describes a person who is good at
            writing articles. “Moon Repairer” is used as a metaphor for a person who is good at writing articles, and
            “Moon Ax” is used as a metaphor for the ability to write articles.<br><br>

            The allusion of “Jade Ax Repairing the Moon” comes from the chapter《酉阳杂俎》written by Tang Dynasty scholar
            Duan Chengshi. A man named Wu Gang1, was relegated to the Moon Palace to cut down osmanthus trees because he
            committed a mistake in learning the art of immortals. Wu Gang cut it with an axe, and the laurel tree would
            heal immediately. Therefore, Wu Gang could only work endlessly and accept the punishment from
            heaven.<br><br>

            Before I was 10 years old, I always believed that Wu Gang, Chang’e2 and Jade Rabbit3 lived in the moon.
            Whenever I saw scattered gray traces in the yellow moon, I would think it was them.<br><br>

            Around the thirty-seventh year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty (AD 1609), the Italian astronomer Galileo
            invented the first modern astronomical telescope. He discovered that the surface of the moon is uneven, with
            craters, depressions, and plains. The real lunar surface was observed for the first time.<br><br>
