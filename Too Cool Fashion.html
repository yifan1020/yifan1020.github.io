    <p>“Too Cool” Fashion</p>
    <p style="width: 650px">“土 tǔ” has seven meanings in the 7th edition of the Modern Chinese Dictionary, including soil; dirt; land; local or regional; folk, folk usage, non-modern; out of fashion, unenlightened; unrefined opium.

        In a sense, “tǔ” may still be an existing state and fact in modern China, and the feeling of “tu” comes from the innate resistance of Chinese people’s thinking.
        
        Rural “土味 (tǔ wèi)1” culture gradually infiltrated into urban memory life during the process of urban-rural integration, becoming a magical realism aesthetic paradigm. “tu” represents a specific urban prejudice or stereotype of “tu is ugly”, “approving of tu” superficially has the aesthetic symbol of “ugly”, but in fact, it contains the emotional needs of rural culture and local residents to obtain social recognition.
        
        The rise of “tu wei” culture has given rise to the “tu wei” trend, one branch of which is the 
        “土酷 (tǔ kù)2” fashion, which is not ugly or rustic but relatively calm. It transforms the “truly rustic” created by the limitations of the times and aesthetic barriers into “truly cool”; using highly saturated colors and patterns that break down class barriers, it expresses the emotions of the last century, merges with China’s unique Z-generation culture, opposes mediocrity, and questions the mundane.
        
        In the early works of “Tu Ku”, China’s street scenes were used as backgrounds, with daily symbols added, and presented in low-pixel effects and “retro” scenes with solid colors that reflect the lifestyle of the last century. However, this does not mean that “tu ku” equals “homesickness”. Looking back at German photographer Michael Wolf’s series of realistic photos of China’s urban-rural border in the 1990s, the scenes and costumes of the characters are incredibly similar to today’s “tu ku” trend. Nevertheless, the subjects must still have the confidence and decisiveness unique to contemporary young people. This almost magical realism’s dislocation and stimulation are the essences of “tu ku”.
        
        Regarding the definition of “tu ku,” Li Zhiyuan once expressed his view: “The English meaning of ‘tu ku’ is ‘too cool’... it shows love and tolerance.” The rise of “Tu Ku” marks a new generation of China no longer relying on fashion trends. The millennial generation has accepted a more thorough globalization baptism. They no longer blindly worship “imported aesthetics” but re-focus their interests on local culture, especially under the continuous accumulation of contemporary Chinese pop culture and the formation of fashion culture since the reform and opening up. The avant-garde has a strong attitude and social conditions to challenge the past and conventions. Clothing is their fashionable medium to reflect current social thought. This is not just a change in aesthetics and thinking. “Tu Ku” fashion is more of a large-scale subcultural revolution in China than a retro-style reversal. This book explores the social phenomenon and cultural issues of “tu wei” and “tu ku” trends, documenting their occurrence and evolution over the past 5-10 years.

    <div style="width: 310px">Footnotes:<br>
        1. “土味 (tǔ wèi)” is a Chinese term that roughly translates to “earthy flavor” or “local flavor.” It refers to a style or culture that is seen as unsophisticated or unrefined, often associated with rural or traditional elements. However, in recent years, the term has been embraced by some as a form of nostalgia and appreciation for local culture, leading to the rise of a subculture known as “too cool” (土酷 tǔ kù), which incorporates elements of earthy style into fashion and art.<br>
2. “土酷 (tǔ kù)” is a fashion and cultural trend that originated in China, characterized by a mix of traditional and contemporary elements, often using bold and vibrant colors, patterns, and designs. The term “tu” means “earth” or “soil,” representing the connection to the land and a return to traditional roots, while “ku” means “cool,” indicating a modern and trendy attitude. “tu ku” fashion is a cultural phenomenon which is associated with a rejection of mainstream aesthetics and a celebration of a certain kind of “rustic” or “unsophisticated” style.
