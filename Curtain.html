            A discussion of the relationship between architecture and interior design in the 20th century. It reveals
            some points about the design hierarchy and gender design situation of different eras.<br><br>

            Two articles are included in this pamphlet:<br><br>

            1. Curtain Wars: Architects, Decorators, and the 20th-Century Domestic Interior (initially published in 2002
            as part of Issue No. 16: HARD Soft Cool WARM... Gender in Design, plus Classic Books Part II.)<br>
            2. E.1027 Eileen Gray Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, co-designed by Jean Badovici 1927-1929 written by Grace
            Coulter<br><br>

            The first article, “Curtain Wars,” ingeniously use
            curtains, which is an element of the domestic interior on which the hands of the decorator and the architect
            come directly into contact, embody many of the tensions and prejudices that have divided interior designers
            and architects since the emergence of the professional decorator in the late 19th century. The writer uses
            an ironic thing, the “curtain wall,” the iconic modernist glass façade that has come to embody so many
            critical values of contemporary architecture. He came up with a question: are architecture and interior
            decoration oppositional practices, or are they, as the term “curtain wall” suggests, more interdependent
            than we think? These two rival but overlapping design practices evoke deeper cultural conflicts supported
            and sustained by profound social anxieties about gender and sexuality.<br><br>

            The second article is more like academic architecture content. Since the first article uncovered modernism,
            architects like Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier enlisted gender prejudices to repudiate ornament, which they
            considered an extraneous addition to buildings that potentially corrupted their formal integrity. This
            content reveals a house designed by a female designer Eileen Gray which made Le Corbusier so obsessed that
            he ultimately built his abode on an adjacent plot of land. But, the importance of Gray’s work has been
            largely erased from history. Her name was until recently ignored in the accounts of modern architecture.
            From a feminist perspective, it can be used to explain how E.1027 has been largely ignored despite being a
            unique example of contemporary design. It explains that woman’s role has been marginalized historically but
            that work by women has also suffered. Although there is a general acceptance and shift towards equality in
            Western society for women and other minorities today, Gray worked in a very different context eighty years
            ago.<br><br>
