      <p>
        During Linda Van Deursen three-week workshop, she encouraged us to reflect on graphic design elements that are
        currently prevalent on digital platforms. These images show an ideal, untouched, and immaculate version of
        graphic design.<br><br>

        Is it important whether these objects really exist?<br>
        Can this image of graphic design be challenged?<br>
        Can the image of graphic design be used to other ends?<br>
        Can it be tested and pushed?<br>
        Can it be undermined, corrupted, or subverted?<br><br>

        I was guided and inspired by her to reproduce the four tailoring lines of Margiela on the surfaces of objects.
