            Auriol is a display typeface created by George Auriol in 1901 in Paris. The letterform he designed are
            distinguished by brush-like, unconnected strokes influenced by Japanese calligraphy.<br><br>

            Auriol became a popular typeface in Europe and America in the early 20th century and was widely used as a
            display type in books, posters, and the applied arts. It also was adopted for signage at Paris Metro
            stations.<br><br>

            I was attracted by the imprecise and calligraphic strokes of this font, like a beauty at first sight, I
            chose it without hesitation, and in the process of drawing this font, I could feel the designer’s free will
            in designing this font. But when you see it turned into a small font(under 12pt) in the article, you can
            still feel its beauty.<br><br>
