      <!-- “Aesthetic freedom is the starting point of all freedom.”<br>
      —Luo Fuxing1<br><br> -->

      While working on a book about “To Cool” fashion, I noticed Shamate. They are migrant workers who like to get
      attention with exaggerated hairstyles. I used their hair as the main body as a collage, and then it seemed that
      these hairs grew out of this landscape.<br><br>

      Because this group initially wanted to be seen, but in the end, the public's disgust and antipathy towards them
      made them hide. So it's like this brightly colored hair is looming in this landscape painting.



      <!-- Colorful, grotesque, sky-high, artificial “blind” configuration, these adjectives are used to describe hairstyles,
      the first general word that comes to mind must be “Shamate2”, the public often use “ugly”, “Wonderful” to express
      dislike of Shamate’s hairstyle.This is the common experience of Shamate, as long as it looks “social” enough, it
      will be safer. Exaggerated shapes, hairstyles, colors, makeup, and props are all just means of spiritual
      “self-defense”.<br><br>
      The word “Shamate” comes from the transliteration of the English word “Smart”, which means fashionable. The
      closest thing to it is the Japanese visual kei culture. Luo Fuxing, the founder of Shamate, said that his favorite
      Japanese visual kei artist is Miyavi. The idol of my junior high school friend.<br><br>
      Shamate fuzzy originated around the millennium, developed and blocked ten years ago, and still exists in unknown
      corners until now. The way for it to enter the mainstream field of vision is the plight of migrant workers
      shrouded in aesthetic freedom. Who “killed” them. This kind of aesthetics is recognized by the public as
      “brain-dead”, “cottage”, “idiot”, “lunatic”... They are the lower class workers in society, but they also help
      society develop the economy. They became more underground due to the backlash from mainstream society. Shamate has
      experienced rise, peak, and ban in the current ever-changing trend, and gradually faded out of the public eye.
      They let down their exaggerated hair, hid in the assembly line of the factory again, and once again became one of
      the thousands of anonymous workers.<br><br>
      Director Li Yifan began to search for Shamate groups in 2017. Starting from Shenzhen, he interviewed a total of 67
      Shamates in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Dongguan, Guiyang, Bijie, Qiandongnan Prefecture, Qianxinan Prefecture, Dali and
      other places. Li found that Shamates have not really disappeared, and there are still some young people and
      workers in rural areas who continue this aesthetic. Aesthetics and situation are mutually causal. A worker said in
      an interview that after playing Shamate, he suddenly felt less painful and less numb. He needs this strong
      stimulation to find this sense of existence.<br><br>
      Most of the “Shamate” are left-behind children. They were only 14 or 15 years old when they came out of the
      countryside to work. The high intensity of the factory made them always spend 8-12 hours in overtime. Sometimes
      after work, there is no sound for an hour or two. If it wasn’t something very intense, they wouldn’t see it at
      all. Their visual system needs a lot of stimulation, just like their hair.<br><br>
      They say they want to be seen, they need attention.As long as it is attention, even if this attention is a kind of
      “contempt”. So, something as strong as an upright hairstyle is attractive.<br><br>
      From 2012 to 2013, the global economy was in a recession and the domestic economic situation was weak. The small
      factories that Shamates relied on for their survival gradually disappeared as the end of the industrial chain, and
      the whole society looked at them with strange eyes. Even the police would take care of them, they couldn’t rent a
      house with that hair, and some people would beat and insult them because of their hairstyle, and check their ID
      cards. They start to fear the outside world.<br><br>
      When we discuss Shamate, it is difficult to separate labor rights from aesthetic freedom. And “aesthetic freedom”
      can often arouse more resonance, such as some queer groups, who have the courage to do something “out of line” to
      resist this specially disciplined society. Resisting social discipline in a way that deviates from mainstream
      aesthetics is a characteristic of subcultures, and the essential difference between Shamate is that they have not
      formed any system that can be called “culture” except for their iconic hairstyles. Shamate’s plight is the plight
      of low-level workers. They are assembly line workers who have dropped out of primary and secondary schools. The
      only choices they have are hair, parks, and roller skating rinks. Emphasizing aesthetic freedom will weaken the
      attention to labor rights. However, Shamate’s retreat is essentially the loss of the workers’ right to speak.<br><br>
      The American “Foreign Policy” magazine once commented: Shamate’s exaggerated fashion choices reflect a deeper
      problem: collective alienation. This is a by-product of China’s large-scale migrant workers widening class
      differences. Although Shamate’s style comes from punk, visual kei and other European and American subcultural
      trends, it is completely opposite to punk’s attitude against consumerism. Shamate who has entered the city from
      the countryside needs to find solace from the symbols of consumerism. With a maverick appearance, what the killers
      want is not to resist anything, but to protect themselves and gain a sense of security. Dramatically, large
      factories could not accept the way workers spontaneously formed communities. Therefore, Shamate, who had never
      thought of rebellion, passively became a symbol of rebellion. To a certain extent, this is also an important
      reason why Shamate has attracted much attention today, but Shamate has never been a “niche culture that needs to
      be accepted by the public”, but urban-rural differences, capital monopoly and class differentiation. The complex
      dilemma of co-constructing young workers.<br><br>
      Fashion and the trend of the times are constantly rolling forward, but Shamate culture seems to be still stuck in
      the past.<br><br>

      permed, and she wouldn’t come and break us up again.”<br>
