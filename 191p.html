            A surprising animism is being reborn. We know now that we are surrounded by inhuman existences.<br>
            —Jean Epstein<br><br>

            Flowers and many humble houseplants sense and respond to human thoughts and emotions.<br><br>

            Flowers don’t have a nervous system, but they can still sense what’s going on and experience sensations akin
            to pain. When a flower is cut, it emits an electrical current, signaling like injured human tissue.<br><br>

            The “sorrow” and “struggle” of plants and flowers, the “rhythm of their movement,” and their “feeling” tell
            us that not only can humans have the ability to think or love, but flowers can also breathe, bloom and die.<br><br>

            Orchids get jet lag too…<br><br>

            These are the 191 portraits I took of the marigolds beside my bed. The lifespan of flowers can
            reflect the length of human life. The marigold was regarded as the flower of the dead in pre-Hispanic
            Mexico, and is still widely used in the Day of the Dead celebrations. Each
            of us is like a flower, starting from a bud, Bloom our fleeting beauty. Then die on the bed, and withered
            flowers have a sad beauty. I reassembled and collaged 191 photos of flowers
            into a pair of eternal flowers that will not die.
