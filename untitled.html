            “In traditional typesetting, the font would be made from metal or wood. Today, the font is a digital file.”<br><br>

            “You youngsters don’t know what hardships are,” said the elderly uncle; “when I was a lad, back in 1913, I
            used to get up at 9 o’clock in the morning and walk the length of the street to get a book from a Carnegie
            Library.”<br><br>

            “Movement from the tactile to the digital is the primary fact about the contemporary world.”<br><br>

            “Even that most cinematic of novels, ‘A Clockwork Orange,’ begins and ends in the Public Biblio.”<br><br>

            “The media are not replaceable. If you do replace one medium by another medium, you’re going to lose
            something, and, frequently, this is going to be something that’s going to be missed.”<br><br>

            “I agree with all the views expressed in the last chapter: the media are not replaceable. If you do replace
            one medium by another medium, you’re going to lose something, and, frequently, this is going to be something
            that’s going to be missed.”<br><br>

            “Books that formerly were in the $50 to $2,000 price range have come down dramatically, because the Web
            makes locating them so much easier.”<br><br>

            Above are some quotes from this anthology. It consists of five different articles. I read them at different
            times, but they are all discussing the impact of the information age on paper books. People no longer go to
            the library. Hypertext, typesetting software...It discusses the game between technology and paper books. The
            weaknesses of print media in typography, printing, and distribution. But at the same time, it is against the
            excessive use of e-books or documents in the information age, which may lead us into an era of information
            disorder.
