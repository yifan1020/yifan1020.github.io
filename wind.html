            “Many flying movements will choose headwind/upwind operation so that headwind will be safer.”<br><br>

            Laurel Schwulst asked us to think about the “wind” in our life in class and asked a friend around us. I
            asked a friend I hadn’t seen for a long time. She was my best friend in junior high school, and now she is
            flying a plane; I was curious how she felt the wind when she was flying, so she answered my above sentence.<br><br>

            This may be my flying against the wind. And the strong wind in my life is my mother and me. I left her, my
            beloved hometown of Shanghai, and came to a completely different city alone.<br><br>

            Under the influence of busy schoolwork and jet lag, my mother and I communicate less, and sometimes I just
            send some emojis. I also couldn’t express my feelings or everything around me on a video call with my mother
            because speaking is always challenging to say a lot of things, especially with parents.<br><br>

            It suddenly occurred to me that when I was in high school, I would write the same diary as the person I
            liked. Today I write, and tomorrow he writes. I am excited when I read the trivial things written by the
            other party, just like the ecstasy when I made pen pals when I was a child and saw a letter in the mailbox.
            So I wanted to make an app called exchanging diaries. You can write a diary on it and send it, but you can
            only see the diary of the other party. Two people can only use it. If you swap the journaled object, all
            data will be wiped...
