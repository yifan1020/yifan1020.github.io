            “I shouldn’t be here, but I am.”<br><br>

            “Here” is one dilemma after another, and for three years I’ve been trying to find enthusiasm, passion, and a
            way out. It’s really hard, to be honest, it fades in sometimes and then disappears, it’s a mushy blob,
            fuzzy, soft, and blurry.<br><br>

            But the only thing I can be sure of is that I like the feelings that words bring to me, about knowledge,
            art, design, and culture. It may not require beautiful design, but “good design.” Milton Glaser once said
            “good” referenced things that were supposed to be honest and truthful, like abstract art. In contrast,
            today, “good” has no moral, spiritual, or redemptive agenda; “good” simply means effective. “Good” means
            “that which sells.” <br><br>

            I want to design with my understanding of things, cultural diversity, interesting words, and language. It
            doesn’t need praise, appreciation, flowers, and rewards. It must be honest and authentic in conveying the
            truth about the good and the bad in the world.<br><br>

            I try to present the language visually and graphically that I like and simultaneously understand and
            consider the audience so the design can include them in the design process;I am more of a reader in the
            design process, and I collect words that touch me deeply in thousands of articles. Even if my audience is
            from different cultures, I still want to convey and share them. At this moment, I think less that it will be
            considered a visually good design, and I think more than a good design is honest and truthful.<br><br>

            Eventually, I started thinking like a designer.
