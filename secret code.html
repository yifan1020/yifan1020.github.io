		<span style="font-weight: bold;">1."Who killed them?"</span><br>
		Source: Redian News<br><br>

		<span class="blue">In the summer of 2021, at a bar near the 798 Art District in Beijing, "The Ultimate
			Character" had a deep
			conversation with the "Sha Ma Te Godfather" Luo Fuxing.</span>

		That day, he had just finished an event and looked a bit tired. But when he talked about the past and his
		ideals, he was still talkative. In the past year, he had organized several "Sha Ma Te-themed" exhibitions, which
		had created a <span class="yellow">wave of aesthetic trends in a small circle and he also had a girlfriend. This
			summer, we found him
			again and discovered that the "Godfather" seemed to have shed his frivolity and gained some maturity. In
			today's
			rapidly changing trends,</span> he and his Sha Ma Te group have experienced a<span class="green">rise, a
			peak, and being banned, gradually
			disappearing from the public eye. They have put down their exaggerated hair and have gone back to working on
			the
			factory assembly line, becoming one of the countless unknown workers.</span> If you ask: Are there still Sha
		Ma Tes
		today? <span class="red">The answer is yes. All of us who are small, humble, and striving to survive are Sha Ma
			Tes. Perhaps we
			don't need our hair to express ourselves, but under the heavy pressure of life, everyone hopes to find a
			breathable outlet.</span>

		<span class="blue">In 2012, when documentary filmmaker Li Yifan, who was nearly 50 years old at the time, saw a
			photo of "Sha Ma
			Te" for the first time, he was shocked.
			Colorful hair, exaggerated towering hairstyles, heavy and glamorous eye makeup, cheap metal clothing... Each
			picture was accompanied by flashy traditional Chinese characters: "Sha Ma Te's Love"...</span>
		At that time, people had many doubts about Sha Ma Te's aesthetics, which were considered "brain-dead,"
		"knockoff," "stupid," and "mentally ill" by the public...
		But Li Yifan believed that under such aesthetics, there must be hidden rebellious meanings, and he gave a high
		evaluation:
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">Wow, finally there are punks and hippies in China! Through self-abuse, let's disgust the
			mainstream aesthetic
			values of society! This is aesthetic consciousness!"</span>

		<span class="blue">He immediately decided that he must find someone who is into Sha Ma Te, and make a
			documentary about the Sha Ma
			Te style to explain the meaning behind this aesthetic.</span>

		<span class="pink">But after four or five years of searching, Li Yifan still could not find a single Sha Ma Te
			enthusiast. He
			discovered that these people only seemed to be active online and were nowhere to be found in real life. He
			couldn't even join the Sha Ma Te QQ group.</span>

		<span class="green">Later, he learned that joining the Sha Ma Te group required strict verification, with the
			most basic requirement
			being a selfie with a Sha Ma Te hairstyle on one's QQ space. It wasn't until 2016 when a friend from
			Shenzhen
			told Li Yifan that he knew Luo Fuxing, the legendary "Godfather of Sha Ma Te."</span>

		<span class="yellow">"Finding the Godfather, this is it," Li Yifan thought. At that time, Luo Fuxing had a neat
			black buzz cut and
			was wearing a simple black shirt, with no trace of the "Sha Ma Te style" on him.</span>

		<span class="purple">Luo Fuxing recalled to "Most Magazine" that when Li Yifan found him, he happened to be free
			at that time and
			agreed to join the filming team, "mainly to help Li Yifan connect with other Sha Ma Te enthusiasts."</span>

		With Luo Fuxing's help, this three-person filming team began a two-year-long filming journey, traveling across
		the Pearl River Delta and Yungui-Chuan region.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">They conducted a total of 78 interviews with Sha Ma Te enthusiasts and collected 915 video
			clips of factory
			assembly lines and workers' lives from Sha Ma Te and other workers. These 915 mobile phone videos and the
			stories of the 78 Sha Ma Te enthusiasts eventually formed a 125-minute documentary called "Sha Ma Te, I Love
			You".</span>

		<span class="blue">Behind each Sha Ma Te in the film is a heavy story.</span>

		<span class="pink">Han Yajie left home at the age of 15 to work. Despite having the tattoo "Left Blue Dragon
			Right White Tiger" on
			his body, he earned hard-earned money of 8,000 yuan, but was still deducted by the boss until he had only 29
			yuan left.</span>

		<span class="green">Bai Feifei suffered from depression due to repeatedly performing the same action on the
			assembly line for years.
			She had attempted suicide several times, but holding a Sha Ma Te wedding became the driving force that
			supported
			her to continue living.</span>

		<span class="yellow">Yun Xiaoshuai left home at the age of 14 for a strange city, with his purple Sha Ma Te
			hairstyle, hoping that
			someone would look at him when he walked on the road, "even if they scold me, someone would talk to
			me."</span>

		<span class="purple">During the filming process, Li Yifan finally figured out one thing: all those "aesthetic
			consciousness, body
			modification to resist consumerism" that he imagined were just an intellectual's overinterpretation. There
			are
			no so-called Chinese hippies, only a group of struggling migrant workers born in the 1990s.</span>

		Most of the Sha Ma Te enthusiasts have a similar life trajectory: they are left-behind children from rural areas
		or small towns who dropped out of school to work in cities when they were in their teens, becoming the lowest
		level "robots" on the factory assembly lines.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">They are the cornerstone of China's economic development, but they are forgotten like rubble
			in the
			corner.
			Their flamboyant hair is not meant to rebel or resist, but to protect their "devices" and signify their need
			for
			unity. Without freedom and the ability to obtain a decent job, "they can't afford to buy a car or a house,
			they
			can only play with their hair."</span>

		<span class="blue">After the film was completed, Li Yifan said, "Without the excitement of the 'Killmattes,'
			there is only extreme
			poverty of life in the 'Killmattes'."</span>

		<span class="pink">The documentary sparked discussions in a small circle after its release, once again bringing
			the Killmattes into
			the public eye. But unlike in the past, there was no criticism or ridicule, and people seemed to feel a
			sense of
			empathy from the Killmattes - a sense of empathy for those who belong to the lower class and long to be
			seen.
			As one of those filmed in the documentary, "Killmattes Godfather" Luo Fuxing had never watched the
			documentary
			about the history of the Killmattes in its entirety. "It's like watching my own life, and I know what my
			life is
			like," he told "The People."</span>

		<span class="green">On June 1, 1995, Luo Fuxing was born in a small village in Wuhua County, Meizhou, Guangdong.
			Before the age of
			five, he lived with his parents who worked in Shenzhen. In Luo Fuxing's memory, this was the longest time
			they
			spent together as a family. Although sometimes his father would bring strange women home in front of his
			mother,
			making him call them "Mom."</span>

		<span class="yellow">Soon, Luo Fuxing, who had to go to primary school, had to return to his hometown in Meizhou
			because he did not
			have a Shenzhen household registration, becoming a typical left-behind child.
			His father rarely visited him in his hometown, and rarely sent money home; his mother would send money back
			regularly, but also had no time to take care of him. Most of the time, he stayed at his grandmother's house
			for
			a while, then at his grandmother's house for a while, and in being pushed around, Luo Fuxing spent his
			childhood.</span>

		<span class="purple">Growing up, he would call his father, but there was usually no answer on the other end of
			the phone, "probably
			because he was afraid I would ask for money." For the longest time, Luo Fuxing had no contact with his
			father
			for five years.</span>

		"Your father doesn't care about you at all. When you grow up, don't give him a drop of water to drink," his
		grandparents' words hit the young Luo Fuxing hard.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">Many years later, he learned that his father had remarried and had a son in Shenzhen, "My dad
			got married twice
			using his ID and name," Luo Fuxing said somewhat helplessly.</span>

		<span class="blue">Whether at home or at school, Luo Fuxing was always invisible. Due to his poor academic
			performance and small
			stature, he could only sit in the back row of the classroom. The 100-square-meter classroom accommodated
			more
			than 70 students, "I can't even see the teacher, and I guess he can't see me either."</span>

		<span class="pink">After several instances of being bullied by small gangsters, Luo Fuxing started to learn from
			the "successful"
			big brothers in order to make himself "stronger": smoking, dyeing his hair, skipping classes, going
			online...
			When he was short of money, he would steal bicycles and dogs from other people's homes, and sell them for
			one or
			two hundred yuan.</span>

		<span class="green">After graduating from elementary school, 11-year-old Luo Fuxing dropped out of school and
			started working at a
			microwave oven factory in his hometown's industrial park. Because he was too young and weak, he was assigned
			to
			the simplest task: taking out the molded molds and placing them on the conveyor belt, repeating this
			mechanical
			movement for 12 hours every day.</span>

		<span class="yellow">"The most fearful moment of every day was when I opened my eyes in the morning and thought
			about the long day
			ahead," he recalled.</span>

		<span class="purple">On the assembly line, no one would talk to each other, and everyone repeated their actions
			tirelessly. Some
			people were so tired that they fell asleep at their workstations, but the machines next to them continued to
			run.</span>

		The air in the factory was always filled with the smell of machine oil and the roar of machines. Numbness,
		danger, and boredom were the daily themes of the assembly line.

		From home to school, and then to the factory, the feeling of loneliness pervaded Luo Fuxing's entire childhood.
		He longed to be noticed by someone.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">In 2007, 12-year-old Luo Fuxing left his hometown in Meizhou and went to an apprenticeship at
			a hair salon in
			Shenzhen. He described that time as very free, "like wild grass." He spent a lot of time in internet cafes,
			"touching the keyboard all day long." As for washing people's hair, Luo Fuxing had a "just messing around"
			attitude.</span>

		<span class="blue">At that time, the post-90s generation listened to the songs of Ben Xi and Xu Song, liked to
			play the game
			"Audition," and were enthusiastic about non-mainstream culture. When decorating their QQ space, they would
			add
			the words "bury love" and were obsessed with the diary of C.K. Chen Ke: "I will die again and again to prove
			that life is endless." Luo Fuxing was no exception. He joined many QQ groups, such as "bleeding," "bury
			love,"
			"visual system," etc. The members of these groups were all obsessed with dark style and punk fashion. Luo
			Fuxing
			searched online and found photos of Japanese visual style singer Ishihara Takamasa. He began to imitate
			Ishihara
			Takamasa's style, hoping to attract others' attention.</span>

		<span class="pink">At the hair salon where he was an apprentice, Luo Fuxing dyed his hair red, had an explosive
			head, used a whole
			bottle of hair gel to fix all his hair into a anti-gravity style. According to his recollection, "this
			hairstyle
			cost my dad 300 yuan, even after it was messed up." He used a computer webcam to record his exaggerated
			style
			and after uploading the photos online, he unexpectedly received many comments such as "handsome," "cool,"
			and
			"fashionable."</span>

		<span class="green">This was the first time in Luo Fuxing's life that he was noticed. Excited, he opened a
			webpage and searched for
			"fashionable." The word "Smart" appeared, and based on its English homonym, Luo Fuxing created the word "Sha
			Ma
			Te" </span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="yellow">He used this word to establish his first QQ group, and the "Sha Ma Te" was born. With an
			exaggerated hairstyle
			as their symbol, they stood out from other groups in the following year. From one group to dozens of groups,
			and
			from dozens of people to hundreds of thousands of people, the internet brought together young workers with
			similar backgrounds. Unconsciously, the Sha Ma Tes occupied the streets around the internet and factories,
			with
			colorful and spiky hair everywhere.</span>

		<span class="purple">When the Sha Ma Tes came off the indifferent assembly line, the family QQ group became
			their warm harbor. The
			cool hairstyle gave them a sense of belonging they had never had before, and in the family, there was no
			discrimination or exclusion, only shared hobbies.</span>

		<span class="red">As the godfather, Luo Fuxing led his family members in charging onto the internet, going to
			various forums to
			promote the "Sha Ma Te" and posting their photos and QQ group numbers to recruit new members. According to
			Luo
			Fuxing's recollection, they even went to the "Li Yi Forum" to promote, but they were
			counter-attacked.</span>

		<span class="blue">In the "Sha Ma Te Empire," Luo Fuxing finally found a sense of presence. To consolidate this
			sense of presence,
			he tattooed his name on many parts of his body, such as "I'm Luo Fuxing," "LFX," "Leading the mainstream,"
			"I."
			"I just want more people to remember this name, and I'm afraid of being ignored," he said.</span>

		<span class="pink">These unreal days lasted until 2013. A group of fake Sha Ma Tes sparked a network frenzy in a
			self-deprecating
			way, causing public dissatisfaction with the Sha Ma Tes. A large-scale "anti-Sha Ma Te movement" erupted on
			the
			internet, and the Sha Ma Tes suffered a lot of verbal abuse and attacks, which spread to the offline
			world.</span>

		<span class="green">In the documentary "Sha Ma Te, I Love You," retired Sha Ma Te Li Xuesong recalled that
			during that time, going
			out to eat would result in being surrounded and attacked, with the other side pulling out lighters and
			burning
			their hair.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="yellow">The Sha Ma Te became a target of "anti-vulgarity," and even the factories stopped accepting
			workers with Sha Ma
			Te hairstyles.</span>

		<span class="purple">It seemed as if overnight, all the Sha Ma Tes disappeared.</span>

		<span class="red">Founder Luo Fuxing also cut off his long hair and went to work in a larger factory.</span>

		<span class="blue">"The demise of Sha Ma Te is related to food. If you can't even eat, you have to cut your
			hair," he summed up.</span>

		<span class="pink">In Luo Fuxing's timeline, his father's death was a turning point in his life.</span>

		<span class="green">In July 2016, 21-year-old Luo Fuxing received a call from his family, "Your father is sick,
			he has liver
			cancer."</span>

		<span class="yellow">He rushed back to his long-lost hometown of Meizhou. Since childhood, he had always
			harbored a "resentment"
			towards his father, but when he stood by his father's bed and felt his father's dry hands gripping his own,
			he
			instinctively wanted to cry.</span>

		<span class="purple">During those days of guarding his father's bedside, one day his father suddenly said, "Why
			don't I go and crash
			my car, so you can have compensation money and start a hair salon." At that moment, Luo Fuxing had a feeling
			in
			his heart that he couldn't describe.</span>

		<span class="red">In order to let his father live for another month, he borrowed 70,000 yuan from someone. But
			in the end, his
			father did not survive until the Mid-Autumn Festival.</span>

		<span class="blue">This day, which should have been a reunion for the whole family, was also a festival they had
			never celebrated
			together.</span>

		<span class="pink">On the day his father died, it was raining heavily in Meizhou, and the roof was constantly
			leaking. Luo Fuxing
			recalled that his father died in his arms, "Seeing a living person struggling and dying in my own arms was
			too
			frightening."</span>

		For a long time after his father's death, Luo Fuxing would have nightmares every night. During those days, he
		was afraid to sleep alone and would come to his mother's room to sleep on the floor. His mother told him that he
		talked in his sleep at night.

		The hole in the roof that was never patched became a hidden pain in Luo Fuxing's heart.v
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="green">For countless days and nights, he regretted that if he had enough money back then, his
			father would not have
			died in the leaky old house.</span>

		<span class="yellow">"I can't let my mother repeat this scene," Luo Fuxing planned to open a barber shop and
			work hard. He withdrew
			from the family QQ group and stopped touching anything related to the "shamate" subculture.
			But the further he got from the online world, the more curious people became about what the former "shamate"
			was
			doing now.</span>
		<span class="purple">Since 2016, more and more media outlets have found him, and he was even invited to
			participate in the TV show
			"China's Got Talent".</span>
		<span class="red">In 2018, Luo Fuxing opened a hair salon called "Empress" in a Shenzhen urban village, but the
			salon only lasted
			for three months.</span>
		<span class="blue">On the day the salon closed, he wrote on the wall, "Clearly worked so hard to stay in this
			city, in this
			place..." This sentence was captured by reporters who came to the scene and quickly spread on the internet.
			"Shamate Godfather cuts his hair and reforms", "Shamate Godfather opens a hair salon", "Shamate Godfather's
			hair
			salon goes bankrupt", each of these topics became a hot search.</span>
		<span class="pink">Luo Fuxing's reputation as the "Shamate Godfather" became more and more famous.
		</span>
		<span class="green">In 2020, after the documentary "Shamate, I love you" was shown in various universities and
			art galleries,
			"shamate" gradually became a cultural symbol and returned to the public eye.</span>

		The "shamate" subculture, which had disappeared on the assembly line, was revived in the art world.
		Today, Luo Fuxing moves freely in the art districts of first-tier cities.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="yellow">For countless nights, he regretted that if he had enough money at the time, his father
			would not have died in
			the leaky old house. "I can't let my mom experience this scene again," Luo Fuxing planned to open a
			barbershop
			and work hard. He left the family's QQ group and no longer touched anything related to the "sha ma te"
			subculture.</span>
		<span class="purple">But as he moved further away from the online world, people became more curious about what
			the former "sha ma te"
			was doing now. Starting from 2016, more and more media outlets contacted him, and he was even invited to
			participate in the TV show "Chinese Dream Show".</span>
		<span class="red">In 2018, Luo Fuxing opened a hair salon called "Huangfei" in a Shenzhen urban village, but the
			salon only lasted
			for three months. On the day the salon closed, he wrote on the wall, "I worked so hard to stay in this city
			and
			this place..." This sentence was captured by reporters and quickly spread on the internet, leading to
			headlines
			such as "Sha Ma Te Godfather Cuts Hair and Changes His Ways" and "Sha Ma Te Godfather Opens a Hair Salon"
			and
			"Sha Ma Te Godfather's Hair Salon Closes", making Luo Fuxing's reputation as the "sha ma te godfather" even
			more
			famous.</span>
		<span class="blue">In 2020, after the documentary "Sha Ma Te, I Love You" was shown in major universities and
			art galleries, the
			sha ma te subculture gradually returned to the public eye. Luo Fuxing now travels comfortably in the art
			districts of first-tier cities.</span>
		<span class="pink">The godfather has grown his hair long again, but it is no longer bright and exaggerated.
			Occasionally, he will
			tie his hair loosely. On the white canvas bag he carries, Luo Fuxing personally writes "smart". His social
			media
			profile says, "The freedom of aesthetics is the starting point of all freedoms", like every artist with a
			story.</span>
		<span class="green">Last year, Luo Fuxing held several "sha ma te" pop-up hair salon experiences in Beijing,
			Shanghai, and
			Guangzhou, charging 300 yuan for a haircut. On the wall of the salon, he wrote, "Hair is also a form of
			expression." Compared to previous years, the evaluation of Luo Fuxing and the sha ma te subculture has
			undergone
			subtle changes. The theme has gradually evolved from "Sha Ma Te Boys Repent" to "Sha Ma Te is a subculture
			of
			rebellious youth."</span>
		<span class="yellow">In a VICE documentary, artist Yefuna commented, "Sha Ma Te is still avant-garde, but people
			don't believe that
			the bottommost people can do the most cutting-edge things."</span>
		<span class="purple">More and more labels are attached to Luo Fuxing: founder of sha ma te, artist, hairstylist,
			internet
			celebrity... However, Luo Fuxing himself believes that "identity is not that important, but sometimes it can
			be
			useful in certain situations."</span>
		<span class="red">A few years ago, on the program "Talking to Strangers," Chen Xiaonan asked him why he didn't
			use the title "Sha
			Ma Te Godfather" to become an internet celebrity and make money on short video platforms. Luo Fuxing said a
			widely circulated quote: "There is a difference between being famous and having a good reputation."</span>

		Despite once saying he wanted to retreat from the public eye, Luo Fuxing joined various social media platforms
		last year and livestreams on short video platforms every night at 10pm. Each stream has around 500 to 1000
		viewers, earning an average of about 1000 yuan per stream.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="blue">During the live broadcast, every time Luo Fuxing lost a PK against other anchors, he would
			perform a Phoenix
			dance, sprinkle some cement, and finally release a firework ribbon.</span>
		<span class="pink">When asked by "Most Person" why he returned to the internet, Luo Fuxing replied, "People
			change at every age and
			cannot rely on certain ideologies to live. Essentially, people are greedy creatures."</span>
		<span class="green">At 27 years old, Luo Fuxing is now presenting a more practical state of mind.</span>
		<span class="yellow">He wants to build a new house in his hometown, provide a stable life for his mother, and
			help his two sisters
			who work outside as much as possible.</span>
		<span class="purple">All of this requires money.</span>
		<span class="red">When faced with some malicious comments on social media, he adopts an attitude of "ignore it
			and move on." He
			feels that he now understands self-media well and "knows more about media than the average person."
			As he talked about this, Luo Fuxing suddenly became excited and talked endlessly about the tones and
			characteristics of various media. After a long speech, he fell silent for a moment and continued, "Actually,
			when there are too many so-called good or bad reviews, you will lose your sense of perception and feel that
			nothing has meaning and nothing matters."</span>
		<span class="blue">Not caring is Luo Fuxing's current strategy for resisting the outside world.
			Whether or not "Sha Ma Te" is a "rebellion," it doesn't matter; whether or not to "give Sha Ma Te a positive
			name," it doesn't matter; and how the media shapes himself, it doesn't matter.</span>

		"Many things are not predictable or controllable by me. It's better to think about how to earn an extra 1,000
		yuan tomorrow," he said.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="pink">In Luo Fuxing's view, "Sha Ma Te, I Love You" is only a movie made for the elite and
			intellectuals, although it
			does to some extent allow these people to understand the cruel truth behind the Sha Ma Te subculture, the
			general public still doesn't understand or care about this group, and the movie itself does not bring any
			change
			or help to the Sha Ma Te group.</span>
		<span class="green">As for his identity as the "Godfather of Sha Ma Te", although it has brought him some
			attention, it has also
			made him somewhat worried. On some short video platforms, content related to Sha Ma Te is often
			restricted.</span>
		<span class="yellow">Nowadays, he prefers to call himself a "craftsman".</span>
		<span class="purple">"Even without relying on Sha Ma Te, I can still create interesting hairstyles and get
			traffic in a matter of
			minutes. Is the label of 'Sha Ma Te' adding or subtracting points? It's hard to say."</span>

		<span class="red">Opening a hair salon is still within Luo Fuxing's plan. Compared to the elusive online
			traffic, he believes more
			in the sense of solidity that comes from doing real business. However, due to the impact of the pandemic,
			this
			plan can only be put on hold for now.</span>
		<span class="blue">"How do you view Sha Ma Te now?"</span>
		<span class="pink">"Of course, it's amazing. In China, such an aesthetic culture suddenly grew wildly."</span>
		<span class="green">Although Luo Fuxing no longer wants to be identified solely by his Sha Ma Te hairstyle, he
			explains, "Even
			without my unique hairstyle, I am still Sha Ma Te. Luo Fuxing is Sha Ma Te, but Sha Ma Te is not Luo Fuxing,
			just like how Karl Marx is a Marxist, but not all Marxists are Karl Marx."</span>
		<span class="yellow">The interview took place on May 29th, only three days before Luo Fuxing's birthday.</span>

		He hasn't celebrated his birthday in a long time and has a vague worry that if he has another happy birthday, it
		may overshadow some of the beautiful memories of the past.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="purple">When Luo Fuxing was five years old, his father bought a loaf of bread and a big bottle of
			cola to celebrate his
			birthday. On that day, his busy father cancelled all his work and accompanied him to play at the beach until
			1
			a.m. On the way home, his father held a flashlight in his left hand and tightly held his hand in his right
			hand,
			walking a very long way.</span>
		<span class="red">"I don't want to forget this scene," Luo Fuxing said.</span>

		After his father passed away, he no longer wants to celebrate his birthday.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. He found 100 missing "Sha Ma Te"</span><br>
		On November 13, 2020, an article from WeChat public account "Esquirecn" written by Li Yingdi<br>
		<span class="red">You have probably heard of "Sha Ma Te" to some extent -- young people with bold red and green
			outfits, explosive
			hairstyles, heavy eye makeup, and a fondness for selfies, often paired with metal jewelry and leather
			jackets.
			They were once the focus of public opinion on Chinese social media, but eventually seemed to
			disappear.</span>
		<span class="blue">Recently, a documentary called "Sha Ma Te, I Love You" has caught people's attention.
			Directed by Li Yifan, the
			film follows his search for the Sha Ma Te subculture starting in 2017. He interviewed 67 Sha Ma Te
			individuals
			in cities including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Dongguan, Guiyang, Qiandongnan, Qiannan, Bijie, and Dali. Li
			discovered
			that this aesthetic did not simply vanish into thin air, but has been carried on by some young people in
			rural
			areas and among young workers. Aesthetics and circumstance are intertwined. One worker told Li that after
			playing Sha Ma Te, he suddenly felt less pain and numbness, "he needed this strong stimulation to find a
			sense
			of existence."</span>

		After a long period of contact, Li Yifan felt that "Sha Ma Te is a bit artistic and fragile among workers."
		Behind this is also the urban-rural relationship and the cost of survival and rights issues faced by workers,
		which he has always been concerned about. During filming, Li Yifan also collected 915 videos of factory assembly
		lines and workers' lives from Sha Ma Te and other workers through direct purchases of mobile phone footage. In
		the editing process, he ultimately chose to abandon the traditional director's point of view and return the
		"first-person" perspective to the Sha Ma Te individuals. Below is Li Yifan's account of his experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="pink">I<br>Actually, I didn't expect that the film "Sha Ma Te Love You" would become such a hot
			topic. Many people have
			asked me for resources and screenings, which was quite unexpected. What surprised me even more was that I
			found
			that the core audience was people aged 20 to 35 who had never worked as laborers. However, many of them have
			commented and sent me messages saying they strongly relate to the film and feel constrained in their own
			lives,
			and want to be an outsider like the "Sha Ma Te" group.</span>
		<span class="green">Let me first talk about how I became interested in the "Sha Ma Te" subculture. In 2012, I
			noticed the popular
			"Sha Ma Te" phenomenon online, with images, news, and a series of songs like "Sha Ma Te Meets Haircut". I
			was
			excited because I grew up in Sichuan Fine Arts Institute High School and had been exposed to things like
			jeans,
			long hair, and Pink Floyd's "The Wall" since I was 15 or 16 years old. I naturally felt that resistance to
			mainstream culture is what defines fashion. Therefore, I easily saw "Sha Ma Te" as a new aesthetic, punk,
			cultural resistance, and that was my background. I was afraid that it would disappear, so I had to capture
			it on
			film.</span>
		<span class="yellow">At that time, there were some Weibo accounts, similar to today's marketing accounts, with
			millions of followers.
			I remember one account called "Sha Ma Te Leader" which would post self-deprecating short videos, such as
			wearing
			a wig to cause chaos everywhere, destroying university classrooms, jumping out of windows wearing a Superman
			cape, and rolling around on the street in supermarkets. These videos were very popular, and people who
			didn't
			understand the "Sha Ma Te" subculture thought these were what "Sha Ma Te" was all about. Actually, these
			videos
			had nothing to do with "Sha Ma Te" at all.</span>
		<span class="purple">I used to think that this type of self-deprecation was a form of resistance against visual
			spectacle and
			consumerism, but it turned out not to be the case. After actually interacting with the "Sha Ma Te" group, I
			found out that their most popular phrase was "self-deprecation is not 'Sha Ma Te'". "Sha Ma Te" does not
			self-deprecate, they take great pride in their appearance and hair. Every child thinks that even if it's
			just a
			temporary dye or a flower, they take it seriously.</span>

		However, these short videos attracted the attention of the public. After people started criticizing "vulgar and
		tasteless" online, "Sha Ma Te" became associated with low culture. From 2013 to 2014, "Sha Ma Te" gradually
		declined. Furthermore, initially young people from both urban and rural areas played "Sha Ma Te", but soon young
		people in cities stopped playing, and their aesthetics trended towards something more sophisticated. Gradually,
		only some young people in rural areas and young workers still played "Sha Ma Te". The reason may be that their
		lives are different from the delicate life in the city. In the factory, they can only experience very intense
		things. Therefore, from an aesthetic point of view, they will choose increasingly intense things.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">For example, one kid named Wei Haha left a deep impression on me. He wore an exaggerated wig.
			Many of the
			Killmattes I talked to in my childhood were left-behind children due to their families' poverty. Many of
			their
			mothers had left, including Wei Haha's. He said he started working in a factory making "Baijie cloth" when
			he
			was twelve or thirteen years old. Baijie cloth is a type of cleaning cloth that is very hard. After working
			with
			it all day, all of his fingernails were worn away. He wanted to leave every day, but he couldn't because he
			couldn't get paid and wasn't allowed to leave.</span>
		<span class="blue">Later, he felt that life was particularly bleak, so he bought a wig and started making short
			videos and posting
			them online. He suddenly felt less pain and numbness. He needed this kind of strong stimulation to find this
			sense of existence.</span>
		<span class="pink">On the other hand, the reason why the Killmattes in the countryside can continue is also
			related to the
			connection with the rural and humanistic society. These children live in a familiar social circle in the
			countryside and trust the people around them. However, when they come to the city, they think it is the same
			as
			their original society, and they are always cheated and bullied. They feel safe when they dress up as bad
			boys
			or gangsters, with their hair standing up, and others dare not provoke them. This hairstyle aesthetic has
			also
			become an intermediary, automatically connecting these people. For example, they can huddle together for
			warmth
			and find a sense of existence in each other.</span>
		<span class="green">Overall, for them, Killmattes are a little light in those particularly bitter and dark days.
			I interviewed
			"Killmattes Master" Luo Fuxing in my film. He realized that we are creating an illusion, but even if it is
			an
			illusion, it can resist that kind of despair.</span>
		<span class="yellow">I think they also have a bit of hippie element in them, a bit like Cui Jian singing
			"Nothing to My Name." Luo
			Fuxing and others feel that the money they have in their hands is useless. Their parents use the money
			earned
			from work to repair houses and send their children to school. However, they are like the second generation
			of
			migrant workers, and they cannot afford to buy a house in the city. They can only earn a few thousand yuan a
			year by working, but they see numbers in entertainment news every day that are in the billions or tens of
			millions. The contrast makes them feel powerless.</span>
		<span class="purple">You mentioned Sanhe Dashen, but if Killmattes went to gamble and pawned their ID cards,
			wouldn't they be like
			Sanhe Dashen? However, Killmattes are currently working steadily, just with dyed hair. I think Killmattes
			are a
			bit artistic and fragile among workers. Most workers are not particular because they are tired from work,
			but
			Killmattes spend thirty or forty yuan to make a style, spray hairspray, and dye their hair, which shows a
			bit of
			artistic taste.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		During the process of shooting this film, until I went to Shipai in Guangdong in 2018, I had always thought
		that the group of "Sha Ma Te" was a thing of the past, including the leader Luo Fuxing. When I went to see him,
		he had just shaved his head. Later, the public had a great misunderstanding and hostility towards the "Sha Ma
		Te" group, and they felt like they had made a mistake. Luo Fuxing often said that he wanted to "turn over a new
		leaf and start anew."
		<span class="red">But now, Luo Fuxing dares to walk on the street with long hair again, and he has also brought
			in some young
			people who love to play "Sha Ma Te" into the group again. Maybe it's because when we were filming this
			movie, he
			and I visited many "Sha Ma Te" groups together, and he gradually realized that playing "Sha Ma Te" still has
			some significance. Otherwise, workers with depression may jump off buildings. Unlike before, when others
			said
			that "Sha Ma Te" was bad, he would think that they were bad, and that they might have been wrong.</span>
		<span class="blue">II.<br> In the process of getting in touch with the "Sha Ma Te" group, I learned an important
			lesson, which is to
			truly respect their subjectivity. The film also mentions this. At first, gaining the trust of the "Sha Ma
			Te"
			group was particularly difficult, as they were particularly afraid of strangers. Society has prejudices
			against
			them. For example, someone once saw that they were "Sha Ma Te" on the internet, and specifically made
			software
			to constantly curse at them, causing their phones to overheat and crash. When they play games, there are
			also
			people who constantly curse at them in the game room. Some people have even been beaten and had their hair
			burned.</span>
		<span class="pink">Last year, when I was doing an exhibition at the Times Art Museum, two children from Dongguan
			came to see the
			exhibition. I said I would reimburse them for their train tickets, but they refused and insisted on taking a
			ride-share. They didn't even have particularly long "Sha Ma Te" hair, they just didn't want to go through
			security checks to take the high-speed train. When they arrived in Guangzhou, they stayed in a place that
			was
			one subway stop away from the art museum, but they didn't want to take the subway because it would also be
			checked, so they preferred to take a motorcycle. They actually didn't have any problems, but they always
			felt
			like they were being checked and monitored.</span>
		<span class="green">At first, I couldn't find any "Sha Ma Te" members who were willing to chat, and I couldn't
			even get into their
			QQ groups. It wasn't until later that I contacted Luo Fuxing, who helped us get in touch with many "Sha Ma
			Te"
			members and introduced us to over a hundred of them. That's why I say he is the assistant director and all
			the
			actors were found by him. In the end, we interviewed 67 "Sha Ma Te" members in person and 11 on the
			internet.</span>
		<span class="yellow">There were many ups and downs in the process, and many "Sha Ma Te" members who had agreed
			to meet suddenly
			refused. Once, we went to Guizhou to find a very important "Sha Ma Te" member, but when we were 10
			kilometers
			away from his house, his phone turned off. And there was a child who answered...</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="purple">I am supposed to interview him at four o'clock tomorrow afternoon. On the next day, I drove
			from Shenzhen to
			Dongguan, and when I was almost there, he told me that there was a bus going back to Yunnan, and he got on
			it
			and left.</span>

		If we look at these things from our perspective, we might think he is unreasonable, talking nonsense, and
		speaking without coherence. But later, I slowly understood that the most important thing is to understand their
		situation, to believe in their subjectivity, and to know why he did these things and what his inner feelings
		were like. For that child, it was not easy to catch a ride, and he didn't have to transfer buses, which saved
		him money. This was really important to him, what's the point of your interview?

		<span class="red">For example, when I asked if they could take a day off, he said it was absolutely impossible.
			We may not
			understand and think it's no big deal for him to take a day off and come out for an interview. But in fact,
			taking a day off might result in a deduction of three days' salary or even affect his perfect attendance
			award.
			In the factory, there are a limited number of jobs, and you might offend the boss or the team leader,
			causing a
			series of troubles.</span>
		<span class="blue">Sometimes when Luo Fuxing and I were together, some of my friends came to play. We talked a
			lot and found that
			Luo Fuxing was very angry because he didn't know what we were talking about, and he felt ignored. We might
			talk
			about buying something for two thousand yuan or doing something for three thousand yuan, and we would talk
			as if
			we were just playing, but actually, we might hurt his self-esteem and he might think we were being
			arrogant.</span>
		<span class="pink">This also inspired me. Later, when I realized that the factory part was essential to the
			logic of this film, my
			thinking was to find workers to solicit videos and organize a contest. But Luo Fuxing looked at me with
			disdain
			and said two things: don't ask for a deposit, and making a thousand yuan a day is not a dream. We bought
			more
			than 900 videos shot by the workers themselves at a price ranging from 20 to 70 yuan, with details of the
			assembly line costing 20 yuan per video and factory life costing 70 yuan per video.</span>
		<span class="green">However, in reality, we bought more than 1,000 videos, some of which were duplicates. Later,
			we discovered that
			some of the workers had cheated us and sent us duplicate videos. We were all confused at the time, with so
			many
			assembly lines that looked similar, we didn't notice and paid twice.</span>
		<span class="yellow">In fact, some of the workers in the film sent videos about job vacancies. What made me sad
			was when I saw them
			checking the workers' hands, seeing if they had any disabilities, and pinching them to see if they were
			flexible. I felt like they were checking livestock, looking at their teeth. But the workers were used to it
			and
			thought it was natural to do so. If your hands don't work, how can you work on the assembly line or screw
			something in? It all depends on the flexibility of your fingers.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="purple">At that time, I had already arrived in Shipai, Guangdong. Shipai is a place where factories
			still exist,
			including the place where the "Sha Ma Te" (a youth subculture) used to gather. The most vivid impression is
			that
			there are all kinds of factories everywhere, which is different from our usual expectation that the first
			floor
			of a building should be a storefront or a shop. In Shipai, the first floor is also a factory where goods are
			loaded and unloaded. Walking through every alley, you can smell the strong smell of engine oil.</span>

		The documentary mentioned a gathering place for the "Sha Ma Te" at a park and an ice rink. But the "Sha Ma Te"
		people were always working, so I took advantage of the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays when they
		had time off. While I was there, I realized that in addition to the "Sha Ma Te," there were many ordinary
		workers sitting on the ground playing with their phones. They were either watching short videos or playing
		mobile games, and everyone was very quiet. The "Sha Ma Te" were relatively more lively, as they would show off
		their hairstyles in the park and go ice-skating. The ice rink had a circular track, and in the middle was a bar
		where they could go in to drink and dance when they got tired of skating. The prices inside were quite cheap,
		only 10 yuan for a day's stay.

		<span class="red">After I finished filming all the material, I went through a very painful process. I first
			edited a 12-minute
			short film that was very visually impactful and based on the thread of Luo Fuxing's story. But after editing
			it,
			I realized that the documentary should have captured the conflicts, the grudges, and the affairs, all of
			which
			couldn't be filmed on-site. Our imagined "Sha Ma Te" was very exciting, but in reality, they were just
			living
			ordinary workers' lives.</span>
		<span class="blue">At this point, I knew that if I used traditional methods, forced structure, or various
			interventions, it
			wouldn't work. I taught video art and short film at the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts, and I always made
			exciting
			and effective films. After looking at countless inexplicable images for more than a decade, isn't this what
			art
			is best at?</span>
		<span class="pink">But I felt that this wasn't right because I felt it obscured the most important things, what
			I wanted to know
			most from the beginning - where did the "Sha Ma Te" come from? Where were they? What were they doing? Why
			did
			they become "Sha Ma Te," and why did they stop being "Sha Ma Te?" I felt that the most important thing was
			to
			let the audience understand their subjectivity. Alright then, I decided to let them speak for themselves to
			the
			audience.</span>
		<span class="green">I tried writing a first-person ending song. After finishing it, I knew how to edit the film.
			The first-person
			perspective is the best way to tell a story. So when you first watch the film, you will see the "Sha Ma Te"
			telling their own stories, combined with various assembly line short videos. I was also conflicted in the
			middle
			because this meant that I had to give up my usual way of doing things. Generally, documentaries don't use
			the
			first-person perspective and usually have the director's perspective. But in the end, I gave up everything
			because the most exciting part of this film comes from the oral history, the interviews, and the
			various</span>
		<span class="yellow"></span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="purple">So I was thinking that the real excitement is not necessarily in the form, sometimes it's
			in the content, right?
			As artists, we know that during the period of modernism, language is the content. In fact, there is a saying
			that later emerged, "Content is language." So I went back to their story, back to the content itself, which
			is
			more important than the forms and structures we think about.</span>

		The most important thing is to make it clear that people understand the relationship between aesthetics and
		context. Choosing a certain aesthetic is because you have a certain context, and this context will form your
		aesthetics. These two things are mutually causal.

		<span class="red">And why did they become heretics? What are the rights of heretics? Is this kind of heresy
			really heresy? Do you
			understand this kind of heresy? Maybe, if we can guide it well or we can understand this subjectivity, it
			can
			also become something very powerful. In the United States, there are brands of black jeans or specialty
			black-owned stores, and they are also great. Why don't we do this kind of thing? Because we don't understand
			this subjectivity, we don't respect this subjectivity, so our fashion becomes particularly simple, and we
			just
			keep imitating richer people.</span><br>
		<span class="blue">III.<br>

			I'm not actually a professional director. I have only made three films: "Submerged", "Rural Archives", and
			"Shamate I Love You" is the third one.</span>
		<span class="pink">When I just graduated from the Central Academy of Drama, I thought making a film was a very
			troublesome thing.
			You have to get a big state-owned enterprise to sponsor it, and you have to deal with kickbacks. I didn't
			understand these things. Later, I went back to Huangjueping in Chongqing, and returned to the art circle. It
			used to be the old campus of the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute. It has always been a very free and relaxed
			place.
			It can have a very market-oriented side, such as selling skewers on the street, while at the same time,
			students
			wear the most fashionable and popular things to do contemporary art and do inexplicable things. It is a very
			mixed place.</span>
		<span class="green">When I returned to Chongqing, my friends were all playing contemporary art. At that time, I
			just watched how my
			friends played, and I hadn't thought about it yet. At that time, I happened to meet a friend from the
			Central
			Academy of Drama who was doing a premiere of a film in Chongqing. We met, and he told me that now that there
			is
			digital technology, anyone can be a director and just buy a machine to shoot. I thought it was interesting,
			so I
			went to buy a machine and started to do it.</span>
		<span class="yellow">In the past, making a film was too expensive. You had to rent a set of equipment, big and
			expensive machines,
			and one tape cost 200 yuan a day. A machine cost several hundred yuan, and they even sent someone to follow
			you,
			so digital technology is also a liberation for individuals. I also prefer independent creation. Making a
			film is
			actually more like a collective collaboration, which I am not very good at, but making a documentary is very
			convenient. I can just bring an assistant and get it done.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="purple">In 2002, I started to go to the Three Gorges to film "Submerged". Actually, I wanted to
			know what was happening
			in the countryside. I saw the cost of modernization there and the drastic changes in urban-rural relations.
			I
			wanted to find the root of urban-rural conflicts. Then I went to the countryside and spent two years filming
			"Rural Archives".</span>

		This is also related to my upbringing. When I was studying at the attached high school of the China Academy of
		Art, rural painting was particularly popular at that time, and Luo Zhongli and others had a high status in
		China, so the school often took us to the countryside. When we were fifteen or sixteen years old, we would go to
		the poorest places, such as Daliangshan, Wumeng Mountain in Guizhou, and Dabashan in Sichuan. Later, it became a
		habit for me to go to these places, and I knew how big the gap was in this society. For example, after
		participating in an exhibition in Beijing or Shanghai and eating in a nice place and staying in a star-rated
		hotel, when you fly to the countryside, you will see a society that seems like it was 200 years ago. You will
		feel pressure and all kinds of uncertainties brought about by this gap.
		<span class="red">I think this is a big problem, and I have never left this topic. Besides making films, I also
			teach and do
			contemporary art. I entered the art circle in 2008 and also went in the direction of social practice, such
			as
			working with other artists on "A Person's Society" and "Sixth Ring Road is One Ring More than Fifth Ring
			Road".
			I always feel that art should have a relationship with society. We always have a particularly simplistic
			understanding, taking contemporary art as imitation of the West, but I emphasize responding to our own
			situation. If you don't respond to our own situation, you actually have no creativity.</span>
		<span class="blue">Including "Shamate Love You", I had an exhibition at the Times Museum last year and showed
			this film, along with
			an installation made up of 400 used phones, cheap daily necessities, and audio files. Each phone played a
			video
			that I bought from workers before the exhibition. Then 8 relatively complete audio recordings of Shamate
			were
			played. The visual impact was quite strong, and behind the 400 phones was a glass curtain wall, very high,
			19
			floors, and behind it was a developing urban village.</span>
		<span class="pink">Actually, by doing these things, I just want to make this kind of cover-up visible to
			everyone, and let people
			see the most ordinary and inconspicuous cover-up in our daily lives. I think this is particularly urgent and
			important today.</span>

		Introduction:<br>
		<span class="green">Friends, this is a collaboration between us and "Sanlian Lifeweek". In the "Hello, Stranger"
			series of dialogues
			initiated by anthropologist Xiang Biao in Sanlian Lifeweek, Xiang Biao chats with guests from various fields
			on
			the topic of "strangers". As Xiang Biao said, the dialogue "is not just about being better to strangers, but
			also about inviting everyone to examine and reflect on their own living conditions." In the third episode of
			the
			program, the conversation turned to "shamate", and familiar faces and voices appeared. As a subculture trend
			that was once popular among young workers, "shamate" is known for its exaggerated hairstyles. More than a
			decade
			ago, this group appeared on the Internet and became a group label, enduring attacks and ridicule from other
			groups. They also became an Internet spectacle to be observed due to the rise of short videos and live
			broadcasts.</span>
		<span class="yellow">In Xiang Biao's view, the exaggerated image of "shamate" is a kind of "self-alienation" in
			response to a
			stranger environment. Over the course of several years, Li Yifan went to factories to interview and shoot
			the
			"shamate" group, completing the documentary "Shamate, I Love You". Facing the camera, a "shamate" said,
			"There
			is no history on the assembly line, we are the ones with history." "They are very anxious about their own
			meaning," Li Yifan said. "Their anxiety starts with their bodies, about their situation, society, and this
			era."</span>
		<span class="purple">In the third episode of "Hello, Stranger," Xiang Biao had a dialogue with artist and
			documentary director Li
			Yifan. Duan Zhipeng, a PhD student at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design and a visiting scholar at
			the
			Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, served as the host for the dialogue. We want to hand over the
			lead
			of this conversation to everyone who sees this. The following are selected and organized text review
			excerpts.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		01. Hair, a belief<br>
		Li Yifan: When I started filming the documentary "Shamate, I Love You" and documenting the Shamate community, it
		was because around 2011, I felt dissatisfied with the state of art in China. The right to exhibit art was
		controlled by capital, power, and major art galleries, making people feel that there was only one way to present
		art. So at the time, we were doing an art project in Chongqing called "Out-of-Province Youth," which had a
		somewhat anti-centralized meaning. These young artists went into society, into daily life, into any interesting
		places where they could interact with others, and created art for people to come and see. During the time we
		were doing "Out-of-Province Youth," I saw Shamate photos from a journalist friend. I was particularly excited
		because these young people were very self-deprecating. From the photos, I judged that they were young people
		from small towns or rural areas who hadn't read many books and didn't have much fun in the city, so they played
		around with self-deprecation. I thought that if he could self-deprecate, he must have some kind of confidence in
		himself, which is especially relevant to our theme. So I wanted to film Shamate, which was the most important
		starting point. But later I found out that this group was not what I had imagined at first. When I was shooting
		the documentary, I met hundreds of Shamates, and the 70-80 people who actually accepted our interviews told us
		that self-deprecation was not Shamate. The so-called Shamates that were seen on the internet were people who
		joked around with other people's photos and were told about Shamates by others. The popular songs at the time,
		such as "Shamate Leader" and "Shamate Meets Haircut," were never sung by Shamates, and no Shamate knew about
		them. Xiang Biao: Li Yifan initially came into contact with Shamate, which was actually a self-deprecation
		borrowed from the Shamate image. This kind of self-deprecation is not the confidence that we imagine. I think of
		our society, which, on the one hand, does not allow failure in reality or in competition. On the other hand, we
		see that failure is a very common discourse in reality, such as "loser," "leek," workers, and bricklayers...
		When people say these self-deprecating words, their true target is themselves, but they use another image to
		mock themselves. So their handling of "failure" is very delicate. Shamates were packaged in self-deprecation,
		and behind the Shamates who were packaged by others, there may be the beginning of a series of very Chinese
		self-deprecation discourse about failure. Li Yifan: Around 2011 to 2012, I was everywhere saying that I wanted
		to find Shamates and looking for them on QQ and other places. At first, I couldn't find them at all. If you
		don't go into the factory area, you won't see those people, and offline, I haven't seen a single Shamate. I met
		Luo Fuxing through a friend, and everything started with him.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="red">Shamate (a Chinese subculture) likes to say "Shamate family" the most. They only have
			confidence
			under this concept of "family." Everyone is of the same kind, this is a self-manufactured illusion, a
			meaningful
			space. I think as an individual, Shamate is not confident enough, and he is also afraid to go far away from
			his
			group, such as the city center. They are very afraid of unfamiliar environments. The internet and
			digitization
			have divided us into various groups, so we don't know where Shamate is, and Shamate doesn't know what
			society is
			doing. The strongest attackers against Shamate are actually the so-called "losers" on the internet. Many
			Shamates told me that during the period from 2008 to 2013, they thought they were the largest popular group
			in
			the world. Later, they discovered that the people in "Li Yi Ba" seemed to be more than them. They were
			preparing
			to expand their influence, and it was after that they were attacked widely.</span>
		<span class="blue">I also try to understand the mentality of "losers" attacking Shamate. They discovered a group
			of people who are
			worse off than themselves, and these people have such a ridiculous understanding of society, so they vent
			their
			contempt on Shamate. I think Shamate is the first group of people to lie down flat. They feel there is no
			hope,
			no opportunity, so they just lie down flat. "Losers" are struggling and dissatisfied, and they will still
			resist
			once they have the opportunity.</span>
		<span class="pink">Xiang Biao: In the documentary, I saw Luo Fuxing describing very clearly, "We can't play cars
			or houses, we can
			only play with hair," but this is actually a retrospective. The Shamates who are in progress, many of them
			are
			only fifteen or sixteen years old or seventeen or eighteen years old. The hopelessness reflected on them is
			different from the other "countercultures" we are familiar with. Some countercultures in foreign countries
			are
			actually produced under hopeful circumstances. Another group we mentioned is "losers," and their
			self-deprecation towards Shamate actually provides us with a very empirical process. They are very negative
			towards themselves, but they also want to make a self-declaration. There are many ways to achieve this
			process,
			including misappropriating some symbols and labeling other groups.</span>
		<span class="green">Li Yifan: Shamate has a larger background called "non-mainstream," which is what we call
			"subculture" or
			"counterculture." After 2008, "non-mainstream" was also very fragmented, and Shamate was just one category,
			characterized by exaggeration. Why are they so exaggerated? I think firstly they feel that working is
			meaningless, which is told by their bodies, not their knowledge. This generation of young people in Shamate
			have
			studied in elementary and middle schools and have not done farm work or experienced a large amount of
			physical
			labor like the previous generation of migrant workers who grew up tending pigs and grass. Then they suddenly
			realized that going to school is meaningless because they couldn't even get into college. They dropped out
			of
			school after the third year of middle school and went to work. They were suddenly thrown into the city, and
			it
			wasn't even a real city, but a certain factory area. When I was filming the documentary, I saw the clothes
			that
			Shamate liked to wear the most, with something printed on the front.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="yellow">How to relieve anxiety? On their backs, they have written "only by getting rich", and they
			do not believe that
			working can earn money. In fact, the "Sanhe Master" that we later saw, who were doing daily wage labor jobs
			next
			to the Shenzhen Sanhe Talent Market, many of them had nothing left due to gambling, even pledging their ID
			cards, so they could only do daily wage work. At least when I was filming, the Sha Ma Te people I met were
			not
			gambling, so this involves the second point, which is that most Sha Ma Te people have some personal
			willpower
			and are unwilling to work on the assembly line for their whole lives. "Unwillingness" is a characteristic of
			Sha
			Ma Te people. Each Sha Ma Te hopes to have something special, and their hair becomes a carrier of this
			trait.
			Even many people have a sacred, lofty, and religious-like belief in their hair.</span>
		<span class="purple">02. Strangers in the Dormitory<br>

			Xiang Biao: In the documentary "Sha Ma Te I Love You", Professor Li emphasized factory work. The documentary
			did
			not touch on their dormitory life. Based on my own investigative experience in 1994, when I was the same age
			as
			those young people in Dongguan Qingxi, I vaguely realized that the dormitory was the place where conflicts
			were
			most concentrated, even more than the workshop, and the conflicts among the female workers in the dormitory
			were
			more than those of the male workers. The conflicts in the dormitory, such as using the toilet and washing
			hair
			in the morning or not, were often the reasons for their continuous job hopping. Later, we analyzed that
			because
			they did not have a mechanism or method to resolve the small conflicts between colleagues, the only way was
			to
			change jobs. This also explains why the turnover rate in factories is so high and they can never form their
			own
			friendships, let alone some units that can work together. Even now, we have found that there is basically no
			communication between the migrant workers and the migrant workers in the dormitory or urban villages. Not
			only
			migrant workers but also young university students are like this. They share a toilet and a kitchen, and
			they
			only know each other's names. This is a phenomenon that is not very common in human history. They are
			complete
			strangers in a private space, and they maintain a strange relationship with each other.</span>

		<span class="red">Li Yifan: Why wasn't the dormitory part in the documentary? Because it is difficult to enter
			the factory and the
			dormitory. From a management perspective, outsiders are not allowed to enter, or they can enter but cannot
			be
			filmed, which is one reason. The second reason is that some Sha Ma Te people live alone. Rent is only one or
			two
			hundred yuan a month. Because they are very mobile, they work in one factory for a while, and then they work
			in
			another factory for a while, so sometimes they will rent a house. There are also other situations, such as
			different shifts between him and his dormitory mates, so they have no interaction time in the dormitory.
			Many
			Sha Ma Te people also told me that a few people from the same village came to sign up for work together, but
			this factory will definitely assign these people to different positions.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="blue">In workshops or different shifts, there is a possibility of conflicts because people with
			close relationships
			may be working together. However, I believe a more important reason is that nowadays, communication is more
			prevalent online, and people live in their own information cocoons. "I only chat with my family and hometown
			friends, play games the rest of the time, and then go to sleep." There is no need for them to interact too
			much
			with the people around them. In a factory with two to three thousand workers ready to work, their work times
			are
			divided very clearly, with one group entering every 15 minutes and another group leaving every 15 minutes.
			Then
			everyone does one thing: look at their phones and do not talk to each other. Their connections are online,
			and
			in reality, they are strangers. When I met Luo Fuxing, he knew so many "shamates" online, but he didn't know
			any
			of them in person. In daily life, they just have long hair. They only raise their hair up when they need to
			go
			out and "blow up the streets." This is a sense of ritual.</span>
		<span class="pink">Xiang Biao: The scene of workers entering and leaving the factory that Professor Li mentioned
			is something we
			did not notice before. Perhaps it is because of the prevalence of assembly lines and various management and
			technological means that the scene of collective work and collective departure has disappeared. We can
			assume
			that in today's factories, all content is distributive, and the factory evenly distributes workers to the
			most
			reasonable state to achieve the highest efficiency. Additionally, when I was watching the documentary "I
			Love
			You, Shamate," I thought of a concept, which is "alienation." Simply put, the factory dormitories and the
			system
			of entering and leaving work are artificially arranged to minimize the intersection between people.
			Therefore,
			the relationship between people is not just that "I am a stranger to you," but rather a deliberate system
			and
			behavior to maintain mutual strangeness. Alienation is a sustained effort. This kind of alienation gives
			people
			a very strong sense of oppression and distortion, and this alienation is actually a kind of alienation.
			Faced
			with such an alienating environment, these "shamates" adopt a strategy of "self-alienation." They create a
			very
			eye-catching image for themselves and go out to "blow up the streets." There is a conversation in the
			documentary that touched me deeply. One "shamate" said, "Why do I want to be a 'shamate'? It's because good
			kids
			get bullied, and I won't get bullied if I become a bad kid." When their hair stands up, they feel safe. By
			turning themselves into strangers in mainstream society - not just anonymous strangers, but strange
			strangers -
			they gain recognition, identity, and confidence. Then, the sense of ritual that Professor Li mentioned also
			has
			a strong social attribute. They have a family and can recognize each other on the streets. Therefore, their
			self-alienation becomes a strategy for them to deal with strangers.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="green">There is a boy in the documentary. He recorded a video of himself dancing while doing Kill
			Matt, a popular dance
			style. When he watched the video, he couldn't recognize himself, but he felt most relaxed while doing Kill
			Matt.
			In fact, he had become a stranger to himself. However, this alienation is different from being a stranger.
			The
			current situation in Chinese society is very similar to the concept of alienation mentioned earlier. Through
			various forms of decentralization, a state of maintaining a stranger relationship is formed. This is
			actually an
			anonymization and atomization, where people are not supposed to form connections, and each individual can be
			directly absorbed into a system. At the same time, there is a trend in cultural mentality where the labeling
			of
			strangers is present in society. For example, Kill Matt is no longer just an anonymous person, it has become
			a
			label. Once a label is formed, various meanings are imposed upon it. We endow various meanings upon
			strangers
			whom we previously did not know or had no knowledge of through labeling. This process is not just due to
			ignorance or discrimination, but also due to complex psychological mechanisms.</span>
		<span class="yellow">On the other hand, Kill Matt has a history, while the assembly line does not. Initially,
			Kill Matt was
			stigmatized, not because they wanted to declare anything, but because they wanted to preserve something that
			they could see for themselves. Then it was stigmatized, attacked, and disappeared. Around 2017-2018, Kill
			Matt
			suddenly became a way to earn money on Kuaishou, a Chinese video-sharing app. However, they also knew that
			this
			was no longer the original Kill Matt. When they dance and perform, they sometimes have to self-deprecate,
			for
			example, rolling around in mud. Therefore, the question I would like to ask Professor Li is about the
			inconsistency between the stigmatized Kill Matt in 2013 and the paid-for Kill Matt in 2017. Both are
			labeled,
			but how can we understand their inconsistency?</span>
		<span class="purple">I don't know much about the people who stigmatized Kill Matt in 2013, but I know that there
			weren't many direct
			economic benefits at that time. They mainly insulted Kill Matt to feel a sense of achievement. When Kuaishou
			introduced paid live-streaming in 2017, there were two conflicting views within the Kill Matt community.
			Some
			people said that these live streams were not genuine Kill Matt, as many of the performers still wore wigs.
			Another view was that these performers, no matter what they looked like, loved, enjoyed, and promoted Kill
			Matt.
			As long as we still have Kill Matt, that's all that matters. Actually, most of the people who paid to watch
			Kill
			Matt on Kuaishou were former Kill Matt enthusiasts.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		We sometimes mistakenly think that people like the "Sha Ma Te" subculture are purely expressing themselves.
		Actually, it's not entirely true - it's that we don't fully understand them. One of the Sha Ma Te individuals
		once said something to me that left a deep impression. He said, "There is no history on an assembly line, only
		people like us have a history." They are anxious about their own significance, starting from their bodies and
		extending to their circumstances, society, and the era they live in. Their hopes may be more illusory, such as
		the historical sense that he mentioned. Therefore, on this issue, I think they are more like intellectuals.
		<span class="red">Among my students in university, when I talk to them about becoming an artist, they feel that
			it's unrealistic.
			They say, "I'm doing online traffic. I don't want to be called an online celebrity. Doing online traffic is
			a
			career, and it's a different thing." So these people who do online traffic are not necessarily what we think
			they are - they just want to explore and even turn it into a career.</span>
		<span class="blue"> When filming "Sha Ma Te, I Love You," I had a few deep feelings. One of them was the
			importance of "physical
			experience." Our previous art was all derived from books and various masters. I think a knowledge system is
			necessary, but knowledge alone is not enough - physical experience is also important. I had to stay in Shi
			Pai
			to experience the factory. In that town, there were endless factories, and I could smell the scent of
			machine
			oil no matter where I went. The sound of machines echoed from morning to night, and so many workers
			mechanically
			repeated the same action. Only after repeating it so many times would you have a profound understanding.
			Then we
			went to their hometown and saw what kind of houses they lived in. If we didn't see it for ourselves, I
			wouldn't
			have emphasized the part about left-behind children in the documentary. There, we saw a newly built house
			that
			was empty except for a bed and the internet. Everyone was making videos in the empty house. Only by seeing
			it
			with our own eyes can we have a tangible feeling, and this will affect the weight of what we film and
			present.</span>
		<span class="pink">Xiang Biao: This reminds me of several things. One is the fracture of knowledge. This is a
			common problem - many
			young people, including myself, cannot see the fracture. Our minds are filled with language from books and
			so-called theories, and we don't allow our physical experiences to impact us. Because the physical
			experience is
			an unpleasant one, our established beliefs may be shaken. So our instinct is to quickly domesticate what we
			see
			and experience into what we already know. This is easy to do, because any powerful and mainstream knowledge
			and
			discourse has the ability to domesticate everything. This fracture cannot be repaired all at once. It looks
			like
			a seam, but once we enter, we find that it is a bottomless pit. We need to constantly correct it. Pleasure
			also
			comes from here. So we really want to encourage everyone to see strangers, security guards in the community,
			and
			people in breakfast shops... We shouldn't just look at them once, we should continue to see them, and each
			time
			we will gain new insights.</span>
	<p>
		<span class="yellow">Look, we can always see new things and then discover discrepancies from our previous understanding. It doesn't
			necessarily mean our previous understanding was wrong, but rather that it was incomplete. This can be a very
			interesting process.</span>
		<span class="purple">Secondly, there is the impact on our physical bodies. Being subjected to the sound of machinery roaring for
			eight hours straight can be a unique experience, one that we may not fully understand until we've been there for
			the entire eight hours.</span>

		<span class="red">Thirdly, there is the imagined physical impact. Ordinary people who don't conduct research or make documentaries
			may not have the opportunity to experience these things firsthand. However, when we try to understand unfamiliar
			people, we can at least try to imagine what they may be feeling when they're doing something. By placing
			ourselves in their situation, we can gain a better understanding of their emotions and actions. This is why we
			emphasize the importance of understanding the context, understanding where these things are happening, and then
			expanding upon it.</span>
		<span class="blue">Just like what Professor Li mentioned, after visiting the hometown of the Karmapa, he gained a new understanding
			of their behavior. In this sense, documentaries or ethnographic-style films may inspire us in our lives. I've
			watched an interview with Professor Li and found it very interesting. He said that if we turn off the sound of
			many news reports, we wouldn't know what they were about and why they were being broadcast. It's because they
			are being broadcast that we watch them, and only after turning up the volume can we hear the clear and
			passionate voice of the news anchor, telling us about the world. Therefore, the world we perceive is the one
			being presented to us by professional broadcasters.</span>
		<span class="pink">In fact, this situation is a reflection of some of our current communication methods. We tend to form
			preconceptions in our minds, and if something doesn't seem to have any meaning, we may not be able to watch it,
			just like how we can't eat a meal without any dishes.</span>
		<span class="green">So how do we view a stranger? With so much happening every day, how do we make sense of our own lives? I believe
			that the most important thing is not to analyze or look for meaning right away. The biggest meaning in life is
			that most of the time, there is no meaning. Many times, the meaning of life is accumulated over a long period of
			time due to various reasons, and it may result in different outcomes. But if we assign meaning to it beforehand,
			it may disrupt our understanding of the result. Therefore, learning to cultivate an open-minded observation and
			seeing the warmth, conflicts, and interesting things in people is definitely worth studying.</span>
