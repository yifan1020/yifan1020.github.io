            Signs, symbols, emblems, and signals, in all their diversity, are penetrating and deeply marking expressions
            of our times, pointing to the future by comprising and conserving something of the past.<br>
            — Signs and Symbols, Adrian Frutiger<br><br>


            We use verbal or written language to express the meaning we want to convey. Our language is full of symbols,
            but we also often use non-strict descriptive symbols or images. Although these have no meaning in
            themselves, they acquire recognizable meanings through widespread use or intentional use. They are used to
            represent the objects they are attached to. When a word or an image implies more than its obvious and direct
            meaning, it becomes symbolic.<br><br>

            For example the wheel may lead our thoughts toward the concept of a “divine” sun; a pointing index finger
            may index (without referring to) some object in the direction of the line implied by the orientation of the
            finger, and smoke may index the presence of a fire.<br><br>

            Fire reminds me of danger, signal, and calling for help, so I have this book.
